Developer notes

Use the Anaconda environment RFI-3DCT in file rfi-3dct-condaenvironment.yml

In a Anaconda command prompt type
conda env create -f rfi-3dct-condaenvironment.yml

Before trying the TDCT-main.py, the other package tools3dct must be installed first.
This is not a conda package, it is a git python package.

https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/tools3dct
and install it (in your appropriate conda environment) using

>python setup.py install

Problems:

For some strange reason it installs:
PyQt5, even though is already installed in the conda environment
conda list, shows pyqt5
tools3dct setup.py installs pyqt5 and pyqt5-qt5

imageio 2.9, even though it is already installed in conda environment.

Moved tools3dct to this project
(please not that there is other stuff in the tools3dct that may be useful, such as the analysis routines)
